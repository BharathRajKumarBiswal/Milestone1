        <p>Given the importance of forests to the planet, sustainable management is essential to ensure society’s demands don’t compromise the resource. Sustainable forest management offers a holistic approach to ensure forest activities deliver social, environmental and economic benefits, balance competing needs and maintain and enhance forest functions now and in the future. Forest certification is the tool to demonstrate this and to connect the consumer with the sustainable origins of their products.</p>
        <p>The three pillars of sustainability
            Sustainable forest management creates outcomes that are socially just, ecologically sound and economically viable – the three pillars of sustainability.
            
            We cannot separate, compartmentalize or address individually these pillars. If one pillar is missing, we cannot protect our forests, forest-dependent communities and rural economies cannot thrive, illegal logging will not be abated and development opportunities will not be captured.</p>
            <p>What does this mean on the ground?
                There is more than one way to manage a forest sustainably.
                Forests are highly diverse, from evergreen eucalyptus forests in Tasmania to tropical rainforests in South America and the Congo Basin and boreal forests in Canada. <br> 
                
                Similarly, their management differs greatly, along with local traditions, cultural and spiritual expectations, average property sizes and support structures such as forest owner associations. 
                <br>
                At PEFC, we ensure that national sustainable forest management requirements are always tailored to the needs of the specific forest ecosystems, the legal and administrative framework, the socio-cultural context and other locally relevant factors.</p>
